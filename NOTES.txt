Building a puppetmaster
=======================
after bootstrapping 
	- certname= and server=
	- plugin sync=true
	- /etc/resolve.conf
	- /etc/hosts
	- ...
	
	- run puppetd -t
	- sign cert
	- run puppetd -t

	- puppet needs to be configured to point to itself, should generate certificate on pm when good.
		-> set certname to #hostname
		-> add alias in /etc/hosts

	- working puppet.conf needs to materialize.
	- clone the git repo into /etc/puppet


	
To make staging work
====================
	- correctly setup DNS entries in /etc/resolve.conf and dhpclient.conf
	- run puppet and auto sign on puppetmaster (via mc?)
