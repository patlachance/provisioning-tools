Acceptance Criteria

LB -> APP "Hello"
LB <- APP "Hi"
Client <- LB "Hi"


--- 


### ON THE PHYSICAL MACHINE ###

# Create LB VM
sudo ./bin/inventory -hlocalhost -edev -glb

# Setup networking
sudo bash ext/define-net.sh 
sudo bash ext/dnsmasq.sh 



### ON THE LB ###

# Install Keepalived
sudo apt-get install keepalived

# NOTES (discovered by asking the boxes):
LB = 192.168.5.231  (dev-lb-001)
VIP = 192.168.5.42  
RIP1 = 192.168.5.238 (dev-refapp-001)
RIP2 = 192.168.5.252 (dev-refapp-002)


### ON THE REAL APP SERVERS (RIPS)

Additional network entry on every APP server:
    auto lo:0                                                                  
      iface lo:0 inet static                                                     
      address 192.168.5.42                                                       
      netmask 255.255.255.255 
ifup lo:0



### LB CONFIGURATION NOTES  ###

lb_algo wlc = CRAP -  A returning node with a lower number of Inactive connections will get a crap load more load until it reaches the same as the other node.
delay_loop 1 - Delay before checking a node is available again (0 = Go as fast as possible, 1 probalby more sensible.
inhibit_on_failure - Should not be used due to "TCP - Keep Alive" (http://www.austintek.com/LVS/LVS-HOWTO/HOWTO/LVS-HOWTO.persistent_connection.html)
