      <h2>Configuration instructions</h2>
      <p>
      Please visit any invalid download URL to see <a href=/>configuration
         instructions</a> for users. For system administrators, read the manual
      which may be available on the <a href=file:///usr/share/doc/apt-cacher-ng/html/index.html>local filesystem</a> or
      be <a href=http://$SERVERIP/doc/apt-cacher-ng/html/index.html>browsable here</a>.


      <h2>Expiration</h2>
      <p>
      Expiration mechanism is needed to delete files from the local cache when
      they are removed on the servers, e.g. when the software versions of the
      package is updated and the package files are replaced. This is rarely
      needed when Stable system distribution is used by the clients, but use of
      unstable branches with high fluctuation requires to clean up the local
      cache from time to time. ACNG includes helper code to identify
      unreferenced files automatically (executed with the button below).
      <br>
      <b>Warning:</b> this operation redownloads all index files. The current
      implementation does not support delta-based reconstruction of index files
      ("pdiff" mechanism).
      </p>

      <form action="#bottom">
         <p>
         <input type="submit" name="doExpire" value="Start Expiration">
         <input type="checkbox" name="abortOnErrors" value="aOe" checked> Stop cleanup on errors during index update step
         </p>
      </form>
      <h2>Import</h2>
      <p>
      Importing package files from foreign sources works in following case:
         <!--
      <ul>
         <li>
         Files are imported from Apt-Cacher 1.x and their meta data is completely available and is correct
         </li>
         <li>
         -->
         <p>
         Files can be assigned to <b>known</b> download locations. The
         locations become known when they are found in index files. However,
         this index files must exist in the package cache, therefore at least
         one client needs to download them, i.e. running "<b>apt-get update</b>" on a client system
         which is configured for use with ACNG. See ACNG manual for more details.
         <p>
         <!--
         </li>
      </ul>
      -->
      When all conditions are met <!--for one of the described ways,--> put your files into
      the "_import" directory, e.g. <i>/var/cache/apt-cacher-ng/_import/</i>.
      Subdirectories and symlinks are ok. Then run import.       </p>
      <form action="#bottom">
         <p>
         <input type="submit" name="doImport" value="Start Import">
         </p>
      </form>
      <p>
      Another kind of maintenance work is repairing the headers. This may
      necessary if .head files became corrupt for some reason, or when the user
      copied files manually into the cache without using the import function.
      </p>
      <form action="#bottom">
         <p>
         <input type="submit" name="doRepair" value="Generate Missing Headers">
         </p>
      </form>
